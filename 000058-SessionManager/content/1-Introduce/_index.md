**The mission of the "AthenaBot" project** is to revolutionize our customer support experience by deploying an intelligent, instant, and always-available Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution. We aim to transform the support department from a cost center into a driver of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

We propose deploying **"AthenaBot"** â€“ a next-generation AI chatbot, **built entirely on AWS Serverless architecture and leveraging the power of Generative AI through Amazon Bedrock service**. This solution will provide instant, accurate, and natural customer support 24/7, thoroughly addressing current issues.

By using ChatBox AI, you will gain the following advantages:

- Automate Level 1 requests, expected to save over 200 hours of staff work per month, equivalent to reducing 25-30% of support staff workload.
- With extremely low operating costs (under $10/month), the project's ROI is almost immediate and will be positive from the first month of operation.
- Estimated under $10 per month, maximizing AWS Free Tier benefits.
- Need fast, accurate, 24/7 responses.
- Provide instant support, anytime, anywhere.

With these advantages, you can use your own ChatBox AI to save costs and make your product more reliable.
