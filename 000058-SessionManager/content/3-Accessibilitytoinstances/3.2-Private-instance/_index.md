For **AWS** models, we need to Request Access before we can use them.
There are many models integrated in BedRock, in this case we will use the model developed by AWS called **Titan Text G1 - Express**.
This is the most cost-effective and efficient model in its price range.

+ Click **Available to request** and select **Request model Access**.
